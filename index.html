        <h2>A LIL BIT ABOUT ME</h2>
        <p>
          In 2018, I made legendary decicion, to open my own FiveM server. 
            I was 22 years old, and I had no idea what I was doing.
            I had no idea how to code, I had no idea how to make a server, I had no idea how to make a website.
            I had no idea how to do anything, but I knew I wanted to do it.
            I had experience with Web Development, but I had no idea how to make FiveM server.
            
          
        </p>
        <p>
         After some time, finally, I did it. I owned server that was one of the biggest servers in my area.
            I was so proud of myself, but I knew I could do better. I knew I could make something bigger, something better.
            That is when i made decision, to make my own scripts and to make server builds ready for people without any experience in coding.
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            <strong>WHY ME:</strong> 
            With my servers you don't only get top tier stuff in your server, you will also get honest opinion about ideas 
            that you want to implement in your server and you will receive support.
          </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          My main priority is to have my customers fully satisfied and I am always giving my best to make 
            sure that they are happy with my work.
            I am always available for my customers
            and I am always ready to help them with any problem that they might have.
            I am also very good with Web Design. Down below you will be able to see some of my work.

          <li>
            "What do i need to have for you to start working?"
            <p>
              You need to have your Windows VPS ready. That is only thing that i can't work without 
                and that is only thing that you need to have. Everything else we will discuss together.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            "How much do you charge for the server?"
            <p>I charge between $150 and $1000 for the server. It depends which addons you want inside of your server.
                If you want to know more about prices, you can contact me on Discord.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            "Do I get full ownership of the server after you are done?"
            <p>Yes, you get full ownership of the server. It is possible that i just send you the files if you require that.
                But usually i set up the server free of charge for my customers on their VPS. After that, if you don't want us to work together
                anymore, you can just change password to your VPS and you will be only one that's able to have access to the files.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            "Can I hire you to be full time developer for my server?"
            <p>
                Yes, you can hire me to be full time developer for your server. We can discuss more on Discord.
